                My fellow animals, I stand before you today as a candidate for the leadership of Animal Farm. I am Snowball, one of the original architects of Animalism and the dream that Old Major shared with us all. I am the best candidate to lead Animal Farm toward the future we all hope for, a life of freedom, equality, and prosperity.<br>
                I am the ideal candidate for the leadership of Animal Farm. Firstly, I am a natural leader who believes in the values and principles of all animals on this farm. I am not a dictator like Napoleon, but rather someone who listens to your opinions and voices. I firmly believe in equality and fairness and will work tirelessly to ensure that all animals are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. Secondly, I gained lots of knowledge and experience while co-leading the revolution that brought Animal Farm into existence. I will use that knowledge to ensure we thrive in the coming years and one day overthrow Humanity. I also fought valiantly alongside you comrades at the battle of cowshed, and I know what it feels like to fight for this cause.<br>
                Some of you may be incompetent and don't support me. You may have heard that I am impulsive and reckless and make decisions without considering the consequences. But let me remind you that those are just rumors spread by those who fear the kind of progress and change I can bring. I am a very thoughtful and strategic leader who always puts the needs of the farm first. I never act rashly or impulsively and do what is best for the farm.<br>
                As for my plan for running the farm, I have three key accomplishments that I want to achieve to make Animal Farm the peaceful and free place that it was always meant to be. Firstly, I will work to improve the living conditions for all animals by ensuring that we have enough food, shelter, and medical care. I would use the Windmill to help supply proper heat and water to the animals on the farm. I will ensure that our work's fruition is properly split with all the hard-working animals. Secondly, I will establish a system of education and training to empower all animals with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed. Finally, I will set a government system where all laws and rules of Animalism will be solidified and enforced. No one will be above the law, including all the intelligent pigs and me.<br>
                Do you want Animal Farm to become a better place? Because if you do, there is one small thing you can do today. That is to be a baller and vote for Snowball.<br>
